Facade (CoffeeMakerFacade): Delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem classes.

Subsystem classes (MilkProvider, CoffeeCupProvider, CoffeeProvider, SugarProvider, WaterProvider): Implements subsystem functionalities. Subsystem classes are used by the facade, but not the other way around. We will come to it later in this post.

Client (FacadeApplication: Requests the facade to perform some action.
